Most of the time, the soft sugar will fall right out. Sometimes, you'll hit a drier spot which will require a little careful whittling with your knife.Carve the window:\nUsing the tip of a small blade (a paring knife or pocket knife), carefully poke out the center of one egg half and carve an oval-shaped hole. This will be the window into the egg's interior.\nLet your egg dry again in the 200-degree oven for an hour, or on a counter overnight. The egg will become much harder -- like ceramic -- and easier to handle. This makes it much more difficult to carve, so make sure you've finished your shaping first. (If you need to make some major changes after the second drying, a Dremel tool is a handy secret weapon.)",

Combine one pound of powdered sugar with 1/4 cup of meringue powder (available at craft stores) in a mixing bowl. Add 1/2 cup of warm water a little bit at a time and use a hand or stand mixer to combine. For our purposes, we're looking for a thick royal icing which will maintain shapes and dry quickly. It will hold stiff peaks in the bowl.Decorate the inside of the egg:\nIf you're going to create a scene inside your egg, work on it while your egg is in two pieces. The world is your oyster when it comes to decorating. Colored royal icing can be set into any shape (For more complex shapes, pipe the item onto a practice surface, let it dry, then anchor it into the egg with wet icing). Coconut shreds dyed green look just like grass. Marshmallows snipped with scissors naturally make rabbit ear shapes, and the sticky exposed interior holds pink sugar for ear-like coloring.\nIn my version, I created a hollow egg filled with jelly beans into which I set a printed bunny, so I fused two empty halves. You can also \"glue\" a piece of fabric or felt into the egg for a unique treat box. (Photos of those versions in the final step.)Fuse the egg halves:\nUsing a piping bag or a sandwich bag with the tip snipped off, pipe a generous line of royal icing around the edge of one egg half. Place the second half on top and line them up to match. Icing may squeeze out of the edge. Simply wipe it off with your finger or a paper towel. This seam will be covered, so don't worry about the line.\nIf you don't have a piping bag set, you can use that trusty sandwich bag, or simply buy the fancy tips for a piping set for about a dollar each at a craft store. Set the tip into your snipped bag and you get all of the same patterns for a fraction of the cost.\nAnd now it's time for our familiar refrain. Say it with me... \"Let it dry!\" Royal icing will dry very hard if given a little time. We're already starting with a stiff mixture, so you might be ready to move on in just a few minutes. A damp paper towel or plastic wrap on the surface of your royal icing bowl will keep the remaining icing from drying out.",

I used an up-and-over motion for this piping, but stars, dots, and straight lines will work too. Any errors can be wiped off the egg and redone while the icing is wet.\nPipe one large line around the main seam and a smaller decorative line around the \"window.\"Decorate the exterior:\nYou now have a basic egg which can be dressed up in many ways. I chose stars with yellow sugar pearls set into them. Use whatever you have around to add color and texture... sanding sugar, dragees, candies, etc. A young child might like their name piped onto the egg, while an adult may enjoy a motif personal to their interests, like music notes.\nIf you did not create a scene inside the egg, you can choose to fill it with treats instead. This version is filled with jelly beans and a printed bunny cutout. Chocolates, jelly beans, pastel M&Ms, or even silk flowers set into dry oasis would work as a gift or centerpiece. I know a certain teenager who wouldn't turn down an iTunes gift card tucked into a homemade sugar egg...Storage:\nThe finished egg does not need refrigeration, but it should be kept dry. Sugar and royal icing don't spoil easily, so wrapped in plastic, the egg should keep indefinitely. I kept a plastic-wrapped sugar egg saved for two decades!",

You can put them in the fridge at this moment and cook them the next morning, or cook them right away if you can't resist the good looking eggs like I did. There are 3 ways to cook it:1. Fry (most delicious but of course highest in calorie): Fry them with 350\u00b0F oil for about 5-6 minutes (a bit longer it you take them out of the fridge). The yolk should be still runny and it made a perfect sauce for the egg.2. Bake (lowest fat but there won't be any runny yolk): Bake at 400\u00b0F for about 20-25 mins would do the job (just when the sausage is fully cooked). 3. Pan fried + Bake (a balance which I chose to use): You can pan fry them with a tiny amount of oil in the pan and then transfer them into the oven, 350\u00b0F for about 10-15 minutes. The yolk is not runny but softer than just bake the whole thing.",
