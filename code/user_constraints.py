        Calculate the configuration score based on user constraints.

        This function computes a score indicating how well the recommended meal configuration adheres to user preferences. When calculating the score, two types of constraints are considered: hard constraints and soft constraints.

        - Hard Constraints: These are strict requirements set by the user. For instance, if the user specifies they do not want dairy in their meal, any inclusion of dairy will penalize the score. Conversely, if they explicitly request dairy, the absence of it will result in a penalty.

        - Soft Constraints: These are preferences that are considered but are not strictly enforced. For instance, if the user is neutral or positive towards a preference, any inclusion/absence of that preference will NOT penalize the score. It is only when the user has a strictly negative preference that the score is affected.

        (By default, a hard constraint pertains to items like dairy, meat, and/or nuts that the user does not want in their meal.)

        The 'hard_constraints' flag determines whether to consider hard constraints (True) or soft constraints (False) when calculating the score.

        Example scenarios:
        1. If 'HasDairy' is set to 0 or 1 and 'hard_constraints' is False, the presence or absence of dairy will not affect the score.
        2. If 'HasDairy' is set to 1 and 'hard_constraints' is True, the score will be penalized if the recommended meal does not contain dairy.
